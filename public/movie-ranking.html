<h1>The Best Movies According to Maxine</h1>

<h2>My top three movies of all time </h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Drive My Car (2021)</h3>

<p>A beautifully shot drama piece covering one's understanding of love and coping with grief.</p>

<h3>The Matrix Trilogy (1993 - 2003)</h3>

<p>An awesome sci-fi series - full of action, 90s vintage tech, and timeless questions around society.</p>

<h3>Shrek (2001-2010)</h3>

<p>An offbeat spin about an ogre's life journey from being a social hermit to an ogre dad. 
Full of funny meme-like scenes and medieval fairy-tale characters with a modern twist. </p>
